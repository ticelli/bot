There is the engine of ticelli bot framework.

## Is it ready for production ?

No.

## Alternatives

* [Howdyai Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit)
* [Bottender](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender)
* [Microsoft bot builder](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder)

## Why another bot framework ?

* Trying to provide a fluent API
* Some lacks in previous alternatives like one hook by intent. Ticelli is able to match many hooks for an intent.

## Run tests

Our test suite is using mocha, so you can run it using `mocha` directly or with the following command line :
